# Applications of Machine Learning Approaches for Discovery of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro Inhibitors
This repository is under the NCATS organization. It documents computational workflows, datasets, and results from a study focused on discovering potential inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein. The study uses machine learning (ML) models and high-throughput screening data to identify promising hit compounds.

**Project Overview**  
The primary goal of this research work is to identify and validate compounds with potential inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein, an essential viral protein involved in viral replication. This work was conducted as part of the Antiviral Program for Pandemics (APP) project at NCATS.  

**Key Objectives**  
- Develop ML models based on high-throughput screening data to predict activity against PLpro.
- Perform virtual screening using optimized ML models to identify promising hit compounds from the in-house Genesis molecular library.
- Perform the similarity-based screening of the hit compounds.
